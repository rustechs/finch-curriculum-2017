	\section{Course Overview}
	
		This section provides a brief description of the \emph{Finch Programming} course, its objectives and keywords, and concludes with a syllabus schedule.
	
	\subsection{Summary for Brochure}
		
		Learn the fundamentals of programming through hands on robotics experiments. Students will use the visual programming language \emph{Scratch} to command and interact with a \emph{Finch} mobile robot. Working in pairs, students will explore the key concepts of program flow control, sensing, human-robot interaction, and autonomy. 
	
	\subsection{Objectives}
	
		The primary course objectives are as follows:
		
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item Provide an overview of the study of \emph{robotics} -- what it is, where it is used, what the current state of the art is.
			\item Introduce students to fundamental programming concepts with Scratch\footnotemark[1] and the Finch platform\footnotemark[2].
			\item Assist students in exploring key robotics concepts of actuation, sensing, human-robot interaction, and autonomy.
			\item Enable the students to develop their own creative demonstration with the Finch.
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Keywords}
	
		\emph{Robotics, visual programming, computer science, STEM, Finch robot, Scratch software, \nobreakdash{autonomy}.}
		
	\subsection{Target Audience and Class Size}
	
		The target audience of this course is rising 4\textsuperscript{th} and 5\textsuperscript{th} grade students with little to no prior programming or robotics experience.\footnotemark[3] Basic computer skills are required.\footnotemark[4]
		
		A class size of approximately 12 students is appropriate and manageable. Groups of two tend to work best, although particularly motivated and experienced students are quite capable of working individually just as well. Groups of three or more suffer from inevitable ``idle hands'', leading to distraction or possible conflict.

	\subsection{Required Materials and Equipment}
	
		The following items will be needed for this class:
		
		\todo{Clean up list formatting}
		
		\begin{description}
			\item[Classroom Projector] Needed to present daily slides and guided lessons.
			
			\item[Finch Robot Kits] 1 per group. One or two extra kits should be available as backups. Kits include a Finch robot and a relatively long USB A-B (2.0) cable.
			
			\item[Laptops] 1 per group. One or two extra laptops should be available as backups. Scratch \& Finch software already installed.
			
			\item[Robot Maze] To be assembled on Tuesday before class (see schedule below).
			
			\item[Flashlights] At least 1 per group. A few extra flashlights would be good, in case some break or groups require multiple for their project.
			
			\item[Construction Paper] At least 20 sheets. Students will use these to describe and diagram their proposed final projects on Thursday.
			
			\item[Colored Markers] At least 20 assorted colors. Same as above.

	\section{Instruction Guide}
	
	This section provides a detailed temporal outline and description of the course curriculum. The timing described here is based on the author's singular experience instructing this course in the summer of 2017, and as such is hardly statistically significant. Additional observations and comments from the author are provided in \emph{Section \ref{sec:author-comments}: }. 
	
	\subsection{Daily Prep}
	
		To make the best use of class time and minimize frustration of students and instructor alike, it is best to set up the laptops and robot hardware each day before the students arrive in the morning. In particular:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Boot up laptops and log in.
			
			\item Connect Finch robots to laptops.
			
			\item Launch \emph{BirdBrain Robot Server} and await successful pairing with Finch.\footnote[1]{This process is not always reliable, and may require a few attempts sometimes. Upon successful pairing, the \emph{BirdBrain Server} applet will show that a Finch is connected}
			
			\item Open Scratch \textcolor{red}{through the \emph{BirdBrain Server} window}. This loads the appropriate Finch-specific blocks into Scratch.
			
			\item Keep the laptops open and logged in, to avoid disconnecting the Finch and having to repeat this process again during class.
			
			\item Connect instructor's laptop to room's projection system, queue up the day's presentation slides (see \hyperref[sec:apdx-slides]{Appendix \ref*{sec:apdx-slides}: Presentation Slides}).
			
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{1em}
		Any additional prep directions specific to a given day are noted in the schedule below.

	\subsection{Day 1 (Monday): \textit{Introduction to Robotics / Finch Basics}}
	
		\begin{timetable}
			\item[08:00 -- 09:00] \textbf{Prep} -- Arrange seats in quasi-rows facing the projector screen.
			
			\item[09:00 -- 09:10] \textbf{Students arrive} -- Greetings; have them sit down in the seats; ask not to touch computers and robots yet.
			
			\item[09:10 -- 09:15] \textbf{Instructor and TA introductions} -- (Slides 3,4 of ??) Who, what, where, why?
			
			\item[09:15 -- 09:30] \textbf{Student introductions} -- (Slide 5) The usual ice breaker, going around the room: name, age, prior programming / robotics exposure (just for reference, emphasize that no prior experience is needed), favorite animal, etc.
			
			\item[09:30 -- 10:30] \textbf{Intro to Robotics presentation} -- (Slide ???) Nothing technical, just a bit of terminology and discussion to get the students thinking about robotics. A selection of particularly interesting and insightful robot videos from YouTube (embedded within slideshow) closes out the session.
			
			\item[10:30 -- 10:45] \textbf{Bathroom / Snack Break}
			
			\item[10:45 -- 11:15] \textbf{Guided Intro to Scratch \& Finch} -- It's time to start working with the Finch! Have the students partner up into groups of two (or three if necessary) at each laptop. This would be a good time to remind students about the rules for using the computers in class. 
			
			\todo{add notes about guided introduction... at the end have some suggested challenge ideas to attempt during the rest of the class}
			
			\item[11:15 -- 11:50] \textbf{Exploring Scratch \& Finch Basics} -- student groups continue to work independently on the suggested challenge goals. Instructor and TA should walk around and check in with the groups, and of course encourage the students to ask questions if they get stuck or perhaps have an idea but may not know how to implement it.
